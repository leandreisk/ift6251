The theme was **art with data**. I used simple words (see the *Dataset* section) to represent interactions between individuals. I also used the `p5.speech` library for text-to-speech (TTS).  

# Dataset  

The dataset consists of two lists of **negative and positive words and adjectives** in multiple languages: **English, French, German, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese**.  

I used ChatGPT to generate the first hundred positive and negative words in English, then translated them using DeepL. The following prompts were used to generate the words:  

- `List 100 words that are positive. Ex: Kind, Beautiful, Strong,...`  
- `Now generate the same type of list, but with negative words.`
