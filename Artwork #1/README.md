# Description ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦

The theme was art with randomness and simple geometric shapes, so I wanted to experiment with the library `p5.js` and to test the functions. I wanted to use and represent the evolution of the framerate and the acceleration of the drawings. I also wanted to test the library `p5.sound.js` to generate simple notes.

My inspiration comes mainly from the YouTube channel [Webdriver Torso](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLiV4WJfkTEHH0b9PmRklw).
